# DETACH

DETACH stands for "Decoupling Exhausted And Cytotoxic Lymphocytes." This computational framework is designed to analyze gene expression data and identify a specific set of genes that can pinpoint a subset of patients where the correlation between Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) and Exhausted T Lymphocytes (ETL) activity is minimized or diminished.

The main goal of DETACH is to uncover genes whose expression patterns can provide insights into subsets of patients where the correlation between CTL and ETL is not as strong as in other subsets. By pinpointing these genes, DETACH facilitates a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the relationship between CTL and ETL, potentially shedding light on disease progression, immune responses, or treatment outcomes.
